# Assignment

**tl;dr:** Create a generative artwork using processing (p5.js) with the overarching theme of this minor; identity (the new intimacy). **The artwork is unique and represents you as an individual**.

The idea is that you set a couple of variables that are unique to you. Design movement, colors, typography, shapes, patterns etc. and your code generate an artwork based on those variables.

_Generative Art is a process of algorithmically generating new ideas, forms, shapes, colors or patterns. First, you create rules that provide boundaries for the creation process. Then a computer (or less commonly a human) follows those rules to produce new works._

* Think about **your concept**, what output do you want the artwork to generate? Look for inspiration and examples of generative artwork.
* Determine your **input variables**, what boundaries (colors, forms, patterns) do want the computer to follow?
* Start coding **the artwork using p5.js** in the browser. Draw shapes, patterns etc. on your Sketch and add a degree of randomness.
* **Add user input**, how can a user interact with your artwork? Can the user manipulate objects? Change the variables to get control over the output?


## Technology

To create the artwork in a web browser we'll be using the JavaScript creative coding library p5.js. You artwork will be a Sketch in the browser which uses p5.js to draw the artwork.

_p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. - [p5js.org](https://p5js.org)_

## Criteria

You'll be graded on 4 topics: creativity, complexity, interactivity & generativity.

* **Creativity:** how original is the concept and artwork?
* **Complexity:** how complex is the code and technical implementation?
* **Interactivity:** how does the artwork respond to user input?
* **Generativity:** how generative (randomness) is the artwork?
