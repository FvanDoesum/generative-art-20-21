# Getting Started

üëã **Welcome to Generative Art!** 

This _getting started guide_ will get you up and running with all the software and tools you need for this course. This guide ends with a couple of resources to prepare you for writing JavaScript and P5.js.

### Text Editor

If you don‚Äôt have one yet, **install a text editor**. It doesn't really matter which one you pick, as long as you feel comfortable using it. However, we do recommend moving away from [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), other editors offer better customizability. **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our recommended choice** but there are others. [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) are both also good choices. 

Take some time to [learn the interface and features of VSCode][learnvs]. If you know your way around the interface, coding will be easier. Feeling comfortable with your tools is very important when writing code. **Take some time to set-up** your colour theme, fonts etc. [Live Server][server] is a handy extension to preview what you are working on.

### GitHub

If you haven‚Äôt already, **[sign up for GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)**. Take some time to set up your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile). Include your name, a profile picture, and a URL to your homepage. Teachers will appreciate it if you upload a representing profile and pick a username that closely resembles your real name. Silly pictures are allowed! _You‚Äôre also allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive information._

**Create a repository on your account** called `generative-art`. Add the contents of [_this `basic_website.zip` folder_][folder] to the repository and enable _GitHub pages_. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz8uNxjGHM0) from another course that will help you set-up your repository.


### Learn

During this course we'll be using [P5.js][p5] a JavaScript library for creative coding. We'll cover some of the details when the course starts but it's a good idea to already learn a bit about the programming language JavaScript and the P5.js library. 

* To refresh your JavaScript knowledge you can follow the ['Basic JavaScript' interactive tutorials on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
* To learn how the P5.js library works you can watch the ['Programming with p5.js for Beginners' video's from Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).

### Introduce yourself!

**Wow, you did it! Virtual high five! üñê** Now you can introduce yourself to your teacher and class. Open an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][issues]. You can pick what are called `issue templates`. Pick the `Introduction` template and fill in the details, then submit. üö® Make sure you never publicly share you _name and student number_ in combination and don't put things you want to keep private in your public repository!
