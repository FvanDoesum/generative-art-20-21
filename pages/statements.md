## Statement on Health

_Your health and safety are important. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course we encourage you to utilize AUAS suppoort services._

**Please take care of yourself**. Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep. A healthy lifestyle helps to cope with study stress and improves your chances of succeeding this period. Study stress includes for example concentration problems, exam stress, failure anxiety, or procrastination.

## Counseling
If you are experiencing difficulties, know that help is available.
Please contact your [student counsellor][counsel] for help with study stress, dyslexia, disabilities, chronic illness, personal problems, etc. If you are studying at the AUAS and you need care from a doctor of psychologist, you can contact the [the Office of Student Doctors and Office of Student Psychologists][office].

Any information you share with the student counsellor will be treated as confidential according to the guidelines of the new privacy law ([the General Data Protection Regulation][avg]) and the [AUAS's guidelines][hvavg].

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. We report it to our assessment committee ([examencommissie](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=1738) in Dutch). 

### Plagiarism
See ¶ 6.1.2 of Teaching and Examination
Regulations (TER) 2017-2018 (in Dutch: Onderwijs- en examenregeling, OER) for
a full definition.

You are not allowed to simply use portions of someone else's work in your project. The copyright is owned by the creator of the work. You must cite the sources used. Quoting or using material without a source citation is plagiarism and is punishable. More information on the [Student Copyright Information Point](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/library/support/search/acknowledging-sources/acknowledging-sources.html). Make sure you cite your sources in the repository, code comments or documentation of your project on GitHub.

### Open source software

We strongly urge you to use free and open source software in the form of libraries and require you to use Node. If you find a project on GitHub (or similar platforms), that doesn’t mean that you are allowed to use it. Projects must have a license that explicitly lets you use it. Acknowledge the authors of these works by citing their name and linking to their projects.

* **Check the license:** pay attention to the license under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and requirements of those licenses. choosealicense.com explains common software licenses and their permissions.
* **Use of libraries (packages):** The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

### Help

In this course, we require you to collaborate with team members. In this course, we strongly encourage you to give help (or ask others for help). Please refrain from doing their work for them. You can often tell when you cross that line. Don’t cross it. And always acknowledge when someone helped you. 

## Statement on Privacy

_GDPR and our university’s [privacy statement][privacy] ensure the
confidentiality of student records._

### Confidentiality

An important part of the experience of becoming a web developer is to exit the walled garden that is formal education.
To participate, collaborate, and join the conversation happening around you on the internet. Which is what we’ll do in this course.

Students are sometimes reluctant to share work online as they are afraid of negative feedback.
Typically though, poor quality work is ignored rather than ridiculed (in fact, most work is ignored).
Good work in a course like this is instead used by students to land job offers in the future.
And the experience of collaborating online often provides a positive transformative experience.

If you are afraid of stalkers, don’t want your family finding out what you work on, or for other reasons want to stay anonymous in the online parts of our course, you may use an anonymous username, email address, and avatar.

### GitHub profile
Teachers will appreciate it if you upload a representing profile and pick a username that closely resembles your real name.  You’re allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive information, but a good looking GitHub profile can help you get an internship or job later.

## Statement on Accessibility

Please feel free to make suggestions to your teacher about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.

### Digital Accessibility

Most of our course material is accessible by default. We check our course material to see if it passes [level AA of the web guidelines][wcag]. 

* We offer **large print versions** of rubrics and important grading documents, you can also change the browser zoom level to increase font-sizes on GitHub
* Most of the resources we use in class are web-based and thus can be **used with a screen reader**, we write in markdown so text gets converted to semantic HTML
* We offer **multiple media types** of the same resources such as video's or audio material so text isn't the main type of content


### Studying with a functional disability
If you have a functional disability or chronic illness that may affect your study progress, you can request a assessment provision.

* Frequently asked questions about [functional disabilities][disability]
