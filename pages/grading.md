# Grading

You've worked iteratively on your artwork and at the end of this course you conclude with an individual assessment. **In a ~8 minute video you'll record,** you'll show the artwork you've created based on the live version and code in your repository. I will look at your video and grade the generative artwork based on the criteria and rubric below.

You'll be graded by 4 topics: creativity, complexity, interactivity & generativity.

* **Creativity:** how original is the concept and artwork?
* **Complexity:** how complex is the code and technical implementation?
* **Interactivity:** how does the artwork respond to user input?
* **Generativity:** how generative (randomness) is the artwork?

## Hand-in

_Make sure you hand-in your work in the assignments slot on Brightspace._

* A `link to your GitHub repository`
* A `.zip file` of your code (for archive purposes)

## Criteria

* The artwork works in your `browser` of choice (safari, firefox, chrome etc.)
* The `code` of the artwork is available on GitHub
* The project is documented (with sources) in a `readme.md` on GitHub
* A `live version` is deployed on GitHub pages

      <td align="center">There is a concept but it lacks vision, uniqueness and effort</td>
      <td align="center">There is a solid concept, the idea is original, there is documented research</td>
      <td align="center">The concept is above average, it's very creative and unique</td>
      <td align="center">Special care was taken to create a unique and creative concept</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Complexity</th>
      <td align="center">The code is incomplete; the artwork partially works with p5.js</td>
      <td align="center">The code is solid and has basic features; the artwork works with p5.js</td>
      <td align="center">The code is complex; the artwork uses advanced p5.js techniques</td>
      <td align="center">The code is very complex; the artwork uses complex p5.js techniques</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Interactivity</th>
      <td align="center">The artwork doesn't (or very minimal) respond to any user input</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork responds to user input; a user can interact with your artwork</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork responds to multiple types of input (gestures, clicking, dragging)</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is multi-device; a user can interact with the artwork on multiple devices</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Generativity</th>
      <td align="center">There is no degree of randomness; the artwork is always the same</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is generative; there is one variable component that changes</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is generative; there are multiple variables that change</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork has a complex algorithm for it's creation and changes based on variable input</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

**Note:**  
_You'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_ you can't compensate between rows.  
_Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on creativity, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.

## Guidelines

We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee (_examencommissie_ in Dutch). Grades will be published and communicated trough MS Teams and Brightspace. After grading you can request 'viewing time' (_inzage_ in Dutch).
