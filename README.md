## Description
Generative Art is a creative coding course **exploring generative art** using JavaScript and the [P5.js](https://p5js.org) library. During the 3 weeks of this course we'll cover everything from the basics of processing to advanced interaction (input, gestures). This course is part of the **Minor Visual (Interface) Design**.

You'll create a generative artwork on the web using processing (p5.js) with the overarching theme of this minor from the [Dutch Design Week (ddw)](https://ddw.nl/en); identity (the new intimacy). The artwork is unique and represents you as an individual. You'll be graded on _creativity, interaction, complexity and generativity_.

## Goals

The main goals in this course:

*  You understand what processing and generative art is
*  You understand the limitations and possibilities of web technology
*  You can create an artwork that changes based on user input
*  You can create an artwork that is generative (degree of randomness)
*  You can build an artwork with code using P5.js

The below table breaks down the general time needed per week.

## Grade

| Task                              | Weight   |
|-----------------------------------|----------|
| [Prototype ][grading] (oral test) | 100%     |
| **Total**                         | **100%** |


```js
if (!prototype) {
  grade = 'GR'
} else if (prototype < 5.5) {
  grade = 1
} else {
  grade = (prototype > 5.5)
}
```

## Programme

This course is given at [Communication and Multimedia Design][bachelor], a
