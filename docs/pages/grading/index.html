<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>You've worked iteratively on your artwork and at the end of this course you conclude with an individual assessment. <strong>In a ~8 minute video you'll record,</strong> you'll show the artwork you've created based on the live version and code in your repository. I will look at your video and grade the generative artwork based on the criteria and rubric below.</p>
<p>You'll be graded by 4 topics: creativity, complexity, interactivity &amp; generativity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creativity:</strong> how original is the concept and artwork?</li>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> how complex is the code and technical implementation?</li>
<li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> how does the artwork respond to user input?</li>
<li><strong>Generativity:</strong> how generative (randomness) is the artwork?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hand-in</h2>
<p><em>Make sure you hand-in your work in the assignments slot on Brightspace.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>link to your GitHub repository</code></li>
<li>A <code>.zip file</code> of your code (for archive purposes)</li>
<li>A link to your <code>presentation video</code> showcasing the end result</li>
</ul>
<h2>Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>The artwork works in your <code>browser</code> of choice (safari, firefox, chrome etc.)</li>
<li>The <code>code</code> of the artwork is available on GitHub</li>
<li>The project is documented (with sources) in a <code>readme.md</code> on GitHub</li>
<li>A <code>live version</code> is deployed on GitHub pages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rubric</h2>

      <td align="center">The code is incomplete; the artwork partially works with p5.js</td>
      <td align="center">The code is solid and has basic features; the artwork works with p5.js</td>
      <td align="center">The code is complex; the artwork uses advanced p5.js techniques</td>
      <td align="center">The code is very complex; the artwork uses complex p5.js techniques</td>

    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Interactivity</th>
      <td align="center">The artwork doesn't (or very minimal) respond to any user input</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork responds to user input; a user can interact with your artwork</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork responds to multiple types of input (gestures, clicking, dragging)</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is multi-device; a user can interact with the artwork on multiple devices</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Generativity</th>
      <td align="center">There is no degree of randomness; the artwork is always the same</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is generative; there is one variable component that changes</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork is generative; there are multiple variables that change</td>
      <td align="center">The artwork has a complex algorithm for it's creation and changes based on variable input</td>
    </tr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
<em>You'll need a &gt; 5.5 for each row to pass:</em> you can't compensate between rows.<br>
<em>Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:</em> for example, to get a 5-6 on creativity, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee (<em>examencommissie</em> in Dutch). Grades will be published and communicated trough MS Teams and Brightspace. After grading you can request 'viewing time' (<em>inzage</em> in Dutch).</p>
